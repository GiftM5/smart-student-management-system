# Smart Student Management System (SSMS) 🎓

SSMS is a full Java-based system designed to simplify student information management — built from scratch to teach and showcase everything from Java fundamentals to backend development.

> A learning-focused project that solves real-world problems in education 💡

## 👩🏽‍💻 Why I Built This
As a software engineering student, I wanted to learn Java by building something real. This system allows me to:
- Learn and apply Java from beginner to advanced levels
- Understand Maven, modular code, and databases
- Create a system that could be useful for real institutions

## 🧠 What This System Can Do (Current & Planned)
- ✅ Add and view student records (terminal-based)
- ✅ Use Java OOP principles (constructors, getters, toString, etc.)
- 🔜 Save and load student data from files
- 🔜 Connect to a PostgreSQL database with JDBC
- 🔜 Build REST APIs with Spring Boot
- 🔜 Optional: JavaFX GUI for easier interaction

## 🌍 Use Case
This could be used by:
- Small schools or tutoring programs to manage students
- Developers learning full-stack Java
- Students exploring system design and code structure
